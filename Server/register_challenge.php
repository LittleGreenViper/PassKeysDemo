/**
This is called (via GET) to prepare some basic arguments for the next step in the registration.

The registration is a two-step process, both of which need to be done in the same HTTP session.

This is the first step, where the credentials are created, and returned to the app.

The app must then return the credentials, along with the generated challenge string.

The file is called with two GET arguments that must be supplied:

- `user_id`: This will have a URL-encoded string, with the unique (to this server) user ID that identifies this user.

- `display_name`: This is a URL-encoded readable name for the user. It does not need to be unique.
