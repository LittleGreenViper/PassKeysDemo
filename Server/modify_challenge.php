/**
    \brief Generate a challenge for the user modification process.
    
    This is called before we attempt access to the user data. It generates a new challenge, which is going to be incorporated into the client data.
    
    Any GET parameters need to be provided here. They will be passed on to the next step in the session array.
    
    We do a cusory check of the bearer token, and pass it on, if it matches, so it can be matched again, at the next step.
    
    The file is called with up to four GET arguments that can be supplied:
    
        - `userId`: This will have a URL-encoded string, with the unique (to this server) user ID that identifies this user. It is required.
    
        - `displayName`: This is a URL-encoded readable name for the user. This is optional.
    
        - `credo`: This is a URL-encoded "crdeo" (any text) the user wants stored. This is optional.
    
        - `token`: This is the bearer token. This is optional, but if not supplied (or valid), then the user will need to sign in again, in the next step.
        
    This returns a JSON record with signature information to be supplied to the app, along with whatever GET data the user supplied.
    
    The GET data is supplied to the next step, via the session. It will not be needed for anything else.
